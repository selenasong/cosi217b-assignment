# Assignment 2

### Flask server

To run:

```bash
python app.py
```

The .db file in the directiory of "instance" stores dependency parsings and entities of the sentence in input.txt (i.e., default sentence in the text box).
If this is your first time opening the server, by clicking on the link at the bottom ("Click here to look at all entities and relations"), you should be able to see the table with what's currently in the .db file. 

If you would like to add new sentences into the database, simply type the sentence in the text box and click "submit". You should see all the entities marked up and all dependency parsings listed, which will at the same time be written into the database. Now, if you want to check the updated database, click the "back to form" below to go back to the first page, then click the "Click here to look at all entities and relations" link again. 

The database should look like this:
